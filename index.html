									<h2>Become a Sandwhich</h2>

									<p>Become a Sandwich is a prototype dungeon crawler game. 
										You play as the protagonist, the Bread Boy, a
										nd fight your way through a dungeon with your trusty crossbow fork launcher collecting upgrades and ingredients that strengthen your stats along the way. 
										Your goal is to become a sandwich that is feared even by the evil tyrant, King Bread.
									
										<br /> <br /> This was a group project for a game design course I took. I worked a lot on the enemy A.I., 
										character stat systems, power-ups, weapon upgrades, and also designing a lot of the mechanics of the monsters and the boss. 
										All the code was written in C# using the Unity game engine. 
										Unfortunately we only had about 3 months to work on it, so the game is more of a demo. 
										Working on this help me learn a lot about working on a large group project. 
										Specifically how the work is split up and how efficient work pipelines are formed.

										<h2>A.I. Denoising Medical Imaging</h2>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="/images/AIDENOISE.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>For this group project, we analyzed the effectiveness of a CNN A.I. Denoising network. 
										We ran multiple tests on the Shepp-Logan phantom with different levels of Gaussian noise. 
										For this project, we used MATLAB and the built-in machine learning technologies that it provided.
										<br /> <br />
										This project was very enlightening on the variety of uses that neural networks have on many different fields. 
										Working with and understanding the internal structure of a CNN neural network inspired me to look further into A.I. and ML topics.

										<h2><a>Computer Graphics Projects</h2>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/results.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>For these projects I used OpenGL and C++ to work with different shapes, lightings, shaders and textures on a very fundamental mathematical level. 
										These projects made me realize the complexity behind generating even the most basic 3D shapes and how levels of abstraction have been built up over the years.

										<h2>Fuel Price Prediction Website<br /></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/ce903463d55f65c777c3e1c7db65d7fd.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A fellow classmate and I created a website for a Oil pseudo-company that would predict to price of an order of fuel deliver to a certain area. 
										The website consisted of its own user log-in authentication system, a customizable user profile page, and a fuel price calculator.<br /><br />

										The website was created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from scratch using PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express.js, and React. <br /><br />
										We used Mocha and Chai for unit testing.
										
										I learned how creating a website without any website building services can be rather challenging and time consuming. 
										I was very intrigued with all the layers (frontend, backend, and database) and how they all communicated with one another.

										<h2>Airline Ticket Booking Website</h2>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images\ER+Diagram.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I developed a Full Stack Website with a partner that stores all customer information in an meticulously design SQL database. 
										<br /><br />
										With this project, I learned a lot about how important database normalization 
										is when it comes to a very large database with a lot of important and detailed information for each entity.

										<h2>Simple Polyphonic FM Synthesizer<br /></h2>
									</header>
									<iframe width="600" height="360"
										src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_j-RjV7qzU">
									</iframe>
									<p>This was my first project in the realm of audio engineering, and was one of my absolute favorites. 
										With this project, I used the program Max/MSP to create a Polyphonic FM Synth from scratch. 
										I was very intrigued by the amount of math involved with audio engineering.
										Using sinusoidal mathematics to create unique waveforms that were compiled into actual audio was incredibly engaging. 
										Seeing my complex code result into something real , familiar, and useful is my favorite thing about programming.

										<h2><a href="#">Markov Chain MIDI Generator</a></h2>
									</header>
									<iframe width="600" height="360"
										src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nyc_HXk-gLE">
									</iframe>
									<p>For this Max/MSP project, I used a Markov Chain to A.I. generate melodies based on an MIDI file of your choice. 
										After the program reads a MIDI file, it feeds all the MIDI data (velocity, pitch, duration) into the Markov Chain in order to train it. 
										Once you build it, the program generates a series of MIDI notes that resemble the orignal MIDI file, while staying orignal and unique.</p>
